)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

This is my solution for homework 5.

## Problem 1

read in the data

``` r
#city_prop_test = function(df) {
#  n_unsolved ...
#  n_total ...
  
#  prop_test(n_unsolved, n_total)
#}
homicide_df = read_csv(file = "./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition  == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition  == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition  == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
## case_when is used to create categorical variables
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") # %>% 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
  #nest(data = resolved)
```

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>

``` r
## make the test result more tidy.
```

Try to iterate…

``` r
results_df = aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_test) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_test) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))
```

## Problem 2 ideas

import one dataset

``` r
path_df = tibble(
  path = list.files("data/lda_data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/lda_data/", path)
  )

lda_df = tibble(
  id = path_df$path,
  map_df(.x = path_df$path, ~read_csv(.x))
) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = substr(id, 15, 20)
  ) %>% 
  separate(id, c("group", "id"), sep = "_", remove = TRUE)
```
