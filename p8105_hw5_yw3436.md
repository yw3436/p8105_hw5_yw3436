```

This is my solution for homework 5.

## Problem 1

read in the data

``` r
#city_prop_test = function(df) {
#  n_unsolved ...
#  n_total ...
  
#  prop_test(n_unsolved, n_total)
#}
homicide_df = read_csv(file = "./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition  == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition  == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition  == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved",
## case_when is used to create categorical variables
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") # %>% 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
  #nest(data = resolved)
```

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
  ) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>

``` r
## make the test result more tidy.
```

Try to iterate…

``` r
results_df = aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(.x = prop_test, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_test) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_test) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high))
```

## Problem 2 ideas

First, start with a dataframe containing the file names.

``` r
path_df = tibble(
  path = list.files("data/lda_data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/lda_data/", path)
  )
```

Second, import the files and tidy the longitudinal data.

``` r
lda_df = tibble(
  id = path_df$path,
  map_df(.x = path_df$path, ~read_csv(.x))
) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = substr(id, 15, 20),
  ) %>% 
  separate(id, c("group", "id"), sep = "_", remove = TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "obs_value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(id = as.numeric(id),
         week = as.numeric(week))
```

Third, make the plot to show observations of each subject over time.

``` r
lda_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = obs_value, group = interaction(id, group), color = group)) +
  geom_line()
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_yw3436_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

``` r
interaction.plot(lda_df$week,
lda_df$id, lda_df$obs_value, xlab="time", ylab="observations", legend=F)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_yw3436_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-2.png" width="90%" />

Difference between groups:

From the spaghetti plot, we found that the observed values for the
control group and the experimental group were about the same at Week 1.
As time went by, the observed values for people in the experimental arm
was getting larger, while the values for the control group did not
change. The difference in the observed value between the two groups was
larger after 8 weeks’ follow up.
