```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```


This is my solution for homework 5.

## Problem 1

```{r}
homicide_df = read_csv(file = "./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Description of the data:
This data set contains `r ncol(homicide_df)` to describe the reported homicide in 50 cities in the U.S. In total, there are `r nrow(homicide_df)` cases. The information includes `r names(homicide_df)`.

```{r}
homicide_df %>% 
  unite("city_state", city, state, sep = ",", remove = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(city_state)
  
```
